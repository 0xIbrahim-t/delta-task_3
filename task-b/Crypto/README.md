## Crypto
Write a simple Python script to implement RSA from scratch (crypto libraries are not allowed).

Take any input and encrypt and decrypt using your RSA implementation.

Sign another input using your private key and verify using public key.

You don't have to generate the prime numbers securely, you can use any prime numbers for your implementation.

### To run this
> python3 RSA.py
